###The Cypher project... 
###Get ready...






GUI that takes user defined password and user defined salt to encrypt a txt file or inputted text 
using desired encryption method and format. Can then be decrypted. Uses a custom key file to generate
the key. The key is generated from the salt and password inputted.








(This project has to be cloned from other student's repo as I did not have github set up at the time.)
